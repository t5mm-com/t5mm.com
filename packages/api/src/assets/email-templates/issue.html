            OpenAI has unified several engineering, product, and research teams
            over the past couple of months to overhaul its audio models. The
            company is reportedly preparing to launch an audio-first personal
            device in about a year. Its new audio model will sound more natural,
            be able to handle interruptions, and even speak when users are
            talking. The entire tech industry seems to be headed toward a future
            where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage.

            One of the big transformations of this year will be robotaxis. Waymo
            will likely partner with Uber in many locations because Uber owns
            demand, but over time, Waymo will want to go direct. Cybercab will
            appear sometime this year and undercut both Uber and Waymo in price.
            Uber's demand for rides will go down pretty quickly once price drops
            - Waymo is currently more expensive than Uber, but it is still
            thriving because people prefer to ride without a driver.

            Mark Thomson is now the director general of CERN. One of the first
            things he will do during his term is to turn off the Large Hadron
            Collider (LHC) to make way for a major upgrade that will make the
            LHC more precise with its measurements of particles and their
            interactions. The upgrade will dominate Thomson's five-year tenure.
            The LHC will reach its end of life around 2041.

            SpaceX is lowering all Starlink satellites from around 550 km to
            around 480 km over the course of the year. The shell lowering will
            be tightly coordinated with other operators, regulators, and
            USSPACECOM. Condensing Starlink orbits will increase space safety,
            particularly with difficult-to-control risks like uncoordinated
            maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators.

            Once coding speed jumps, everything around it becomes a constraint.
            Developers' throughput is now capped by clarifying requirements,
            reviewing changes, validating correctness and performance, getting
            to production safely, and operating the product. The great
            engineering divergence will be determined by who raises that ceiling
            end-to-end. Organizations that update their processes to improve the
            non-code chokepoints will reap the largest rewards this year.

            Writing a lot of tests doesn't always guarantee software quality.
            Engineers need to study target users more deeply to really
            understand how they will use their products. One way to do this is
            by creating AI users to test software. This can result in a feedback
            loop that allows engineers to iterate quickly.
